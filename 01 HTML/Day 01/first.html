<h2>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>
  A Frontend Developer is a professional who specializes in creating the
  user-facing part of a websiteâ€”everything a person sees and interacts with in
  their browser. They are the architects of the digital experience, responsible
  for turning a static design into a living, breathing, and interactive webpage.
</p>
<p>
  Their primary job is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual
  elements, layouts, buttons, and animations that make a website functional and
  enjoyable to use. They bridge the gap between design and technology, ensuring
  the website not only looks good but is also responsive, accessible, and fast.
